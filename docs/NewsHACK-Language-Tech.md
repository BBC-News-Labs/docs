# Language Tech #newsHACK

<p class="lead">
The BBC is looking to increase its reach in Africa, and better serve younger audiences across the continent. BBC Connected Studio, along with News Labs, has partnered with the World Service on a programme of work to support this objective by inviting tech communities in Africa to develop ideas around language technology, mobile formats and audio content distribution. With development support and funding from the BBC, two ideas have already been developed into working pilots, with more ideas currently in development.
</p>
<p>
As part of this programme, a Language Technology #newsHACK was held in December 2014, and a similar event is now being held in London on 15-16 March 2016.
</p>
<p>
The event will be looking at the next step in researching and developing tools in language technology, and we are inviting academic institutions and professionals involved in this specialism to take part.
</p>
<p>
Each participating team will need to bring one or more instances of a 'Language Technology' to use for their prototypes, and to add to the mix at the event. We are looking for concepts utilising:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Speech to text (ideally in a non-English language)</li>
  <li>Text to Speech (ideally in a non-English language)</li>
  <li>Auto Translation between languages</li>
  <li>Speech Synthesis</li>
  <li>Entity Extraction and NLP in non-English</li>
  <li>Multilingual graphics</li>
  <li>Surprise us! (another tech involved in multilingual machine-driven systems)</li>
</ol>

## BBC Developer Resources
 
### [Content Store API](CANDY.html)
 
The BBC Content Store API (aka CANDY) provides an interface to BBC News content with structured metadata.
 
CANDY stands for "CPS and Dynamic", it integrates the Content Production System (CPS) with the Dynamic Semantic Publishing system (DSP).
 
The Content API is a production platform, used internally by the BBC on the BBC website and in BBC mobile apps.
 
In addition to English, the Content API includes articles written in several languages.
 
[Check out the documentation for the Content Store API](CANDY.html)

### [Juicer API](Juicer.html)

*Please note that content from the Juicer is suitable for use only for Research and Development purposes.*

The Juicer is a tool for automatic entity extraction and archiving from BBC News Labs.

You can use it fetch the latest news as well running queries for news coverage from the BBC and other news organisations.

Due to rights restrictions we are only able to link to third-party content and cannot republish anything on our services.

[Check out the documentation for the Juicer API](Juicer.html)

### Example uses of Juicer
Here are a few examples of projects and prototypes News Labs has created with Juicer:

* [News Map](http://newsmap.bbcnewslabs.co.uk) - built with D3.js using data from the Juicer API
* [Who's Talking About What](http://wat.bbcnewslabs.co.uk) - using data from the Juicer API to generate charts for each query
 
### Weather Forecast Data
 
* [How to get forecast data for next 24 hours (in 3 hour intervals)](Weather-3-Hourly-Forecast.html)
* [How to get forecast data for next 3 days](Weather-3-Day-Forecast.html)

### [Locator API](Locator.html)
 
The Locator service is a HTTP API that allows you to discover and ask geospatial questions about places and other entities such as postcodes, news regions, councils etc.
 
[Check out the documentation for the Locator API](Locator.html)
 
### [Nitro API](Nitro.html)
 
Nitro exposes XML and JSON feeds providing programme and schedule metadata. The feeds are the same as those used by BBC products such as the iPlayer.

They provide linear broadcast schedules for all 10 TV channels and 59 radio stations, 7 seven days in the futures, with details of On Demand availability ; a catalogue of all BBC programmes available on demand ; collection of programmes curated by BBC editorial ; EPG-compliant images.

We've put together some [explainer videos](Videos.html) for our APIs which give a quick overview of the different services and API endpoints available.
