# BBC Connected Studio: World Service - Lagos

<p class="lead">
The BBC wants to better serve our younger African audiences in a more digitally focused way and work in partnership with the African digital industry to do so.  Earlier this year we started the process in Nairobi and have since built two pilots, produced a number of feasibility studies, and secured funding for two ground-breaking language technology projects.
</p>
<p class="lead">
We are now continuing the programme, inviting news and tech organisations from around Africa to create innovative online pilots to answer this challenge. There are three areas of interest that we'd like to focus on:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Personalisation - How do we get the most relevant BBC content to the audience in ways that suit them?</li>
<li>Audio - Most people in Africa get their news from the radio. How might this work now that mobile phones are a growing part of daily life?</li>
<li>Mobile and Chat Apps - How does the use of social platforms offer a way to reach the audience with BBC content?</li>
</ul>

## BBC Developer Resources
 
### [Content Store API](CANDY.html)
 
The BBC Content Store API (aka CANDY) provides an interface to BBC News content with structured metadata.
 
CANDY stands for "CPS and Dynamic", it integrates the Content Production System (CPS) with the Dynamic Semantic Publishing system (DSP).
 
The Content API is a production platform, used internally by the BBC on the BBC website and in BBC mobile apps.
 
In addition to English, the Content API includes articles written in several languages.
 
[Check out the documentation for the Content Store API](CANDY.html)

### [Juicer API](Juicer.html)

*Please note that content from the Juicer is suitable for use only for Research and Development purposes.*

The Juicer is a tool for automatic entity extraction and archiving from BBC News Labs.

You can use it fetch the latest news as well running queries for news coverage from the BBC and other news organisations.

Due to rights restrictions we are only able to link to third-party content and cannot republish anything on our services.

[Check out the documentation for the Juicer API](Juicer.html)

### Example uses of Juicer
Here are a few examples of projects and prototypes News Labs has created with Juicer:

* [News Map](http://newsmap.bbcnewslabs.co.uk) - built with D3.js using data from the Juicer API
* [Who's Talking About What](http://wat.bbcnewslabs.co.uk) - using data from the Juicer API to generate charts for each query

* [How to get forecast data for next 3 days](Weather-3-Day-Forecast.html)

### [Locator API](Locator.html)
 
The Locator service is a HTTP API that allows you to discover and ask geospatial questions about places and other entities such as postcodes, news regions, councils etc.
 
[Check out the documentation for the Locator API](Locator.html)
 
### [Nitro API](Nitro.html)
 
Nitro exposes XML and JSON feeds providing programme and schedule metadata. The feeds are the same as those used by BBC products such as the iPlayer.

They provide linear broadcast schedules for all 10 TV channels and 59 radio stations, 7 seven days in the futures, with details of On Demand availability ; a catalogue of all BBC programmes available on demand ; collection of programmes curated by BBC editorial ; EPG-compliant images.
