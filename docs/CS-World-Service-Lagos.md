# BBC Connected Studio: World Service - Lagos

<p class="lead">
The BBC wants to better serve our younger African audiences in a more digitally focused way and work in partnership with the African digital industry to do so.  Earlier this year we started the process in Nairobi and have since built two pilots, produced a number of feasibility studies, and secured funding for two ground-breaking language technology projects.
</p>
<p class="lead">
We are now continuing the programme, inviting news and tech organisations from around Africa to create innovative online pilots to answer this challenge. There are three areas of interest that we'd like to focus on:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Personalisation - How do we get the most relevant BBC content to the audience in ways that suit them?</li>
<li>Audio - Most people in Africa get their news from the radio. How might this work now that mobile phones are a growing part of daily life?</li>
<li>Mobile and Chat Apps - How does the use of social platforms offer a way to reach the audience with BBC content?</li>
</ul>

## BBC Resources
