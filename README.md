# Documentation for BBC News Labs APIs

This repository is intended as a place for **pulbic** documentation for the BBC News Labs APIs and other relevant service.

* Run `grunt` to build HTML from the Markdown documents in 'docs'.
* Run `grunt watch` to have it rebuild it live when you edit the documentation.
* The `grunt www` task is used by the server to build the 'www' directory.
* The documentation is hosted at http://docs.bbcnewslabs.co.uk

This documentation is written in [GitHub Flavoured Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/) which is automatically turned into web based documentation.
